Typing Speed Test Project Description

The Typing Speed Test is a Java-based console application designed to measure a user's typing speed and accuracy. Users are presented with a randomly selected sentence to type as quickly and accurately as possible. The program calculates typing speed in words per minute (WPM) based on the time taken and evaluates accuracy by comparing user input to the original sentence. It also provides motivational feedback based on performance and allows users to retry the test multiple times. This project demonstrates practical applications of string handling, loops, and basic mathematical calculations, making it a valuable learning tool for beginner programmers.
